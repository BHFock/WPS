Version - prerelease

The WRF Pre-Processing System (WPS) is a collection
of Fortran and C programs that provide data which is
input to the real.exe program.  There are three main
programs and a number of auxillary programs that
are part of WPS.  Both the ARW and NMM dynamical cores
in WRF are supported by WPS.


Main programs: geogrid.exe, ungrib.exe, metgrid.exe

Input to the main programs is through the namelist
file "namelist.wps".  Each main program has an 
exclusive namelist record (named "geogrid", "ungrib",
or "metgrid", respectively), and the three programs 
have a group record (named "share") that each program
reads.

geogrid
-------
1) Defines the model horizontal domain
2) Horizontally interpolates static data to the model
domain
3) Output conforms to the WRF IO API

ungrib
------
1) Decodes Grib Edition 1 and 2 data
2) Uses tables to decide which variables to extract
3) Isobaric and generalized vertical coordinates
4) Output is in non WRF-API form, referred to as an
   intermediate format

metgrid
-------
1) Ingest static data and raw met fields
2) Horizontally interpolate met fields to the model
   domain
3) Output conforms to WRF IO API




PARALLELISM

The geogrid and metgrid programs may be run as
distributed memory parallel jobs to reduce the 
time-to-solution.  These two programs use MPI calls
directly, compared to WRF which has an abstraction
layer (RSL or RSL_LITE).




GRIB Edition 2

The Grib Edition 2 compression requires three libraries
external to the WPS source code: zlib, png, and jasper.
It is recommended that users request support from their
system administrators when installing these packages.
Users can compile the code without these libraries by 
not selecting the GRIB2 options in the build.



Building WPS

Similar to the WRF package, WPS uses a two-step:
./configure
./compile
build mechanism, which directs the unix make underneath.
If the user is on a recognized architecture, the
configure script will display a list of available
compile options (usually serial vs parallel, Grib 2
enabled vs a "no Grib 2" option).  For some OS options,
there are multiple compilers that are supported.
Please see the web page for build the WPS executables
on the http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/people/duda/files/wps.html 
page.




STATIC INPUT DATA

The static input data is provided for users in a large
tar file (250 MB to 350 MB, depending on whether bzip2
or gzip files are selected).  This data may be downloaded 
from the http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/people/duda/files/wps.html
site.
